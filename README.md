The schematic I implemented and designed a PCB for, is the ISL6236A. The ISL6236A is a dual step-down, switch-mode power-supply (SMPS) controller that generates logic-supply voltages in battery-powered systems.

I implemented a 4 layer PCB on Altium Designer. I've also attached the Bill of Material(BOM) file for the exact part names and manufacture name of the components.
